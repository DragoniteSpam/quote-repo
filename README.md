# quote-repo
I need a place to organize the ridiculous quotes I collect. These are only my favorites, if you google "\_\_\_\_ quotes" for most of these people you'll have more results than you know what to do with.

Obviously none of these are mine, but I've been writing down the funny stuff I read since high school and it's gotten to the point where I need to organize them all. I have way more than this but I haven't bothered to organize them yet.

You can use these for whatever, like a loading screen in a game or something where you don't have anything better to show, just be nice and append the author's name to the end and stuff.

I'm pretty sure none of them are misattributed but if they are I guess you can submit a bug report or something.

If you've got any good ones that aren't in here, pull request away.
